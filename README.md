# Script for Homework Checker
A bash script, combined with python, to help students check their assignments.

# Main idea
The idea is to help my students when doing their homework. If this script, you can pre-check/grade an assignment. Basically, the script compiles and execute 2 programs(one from professor and one from student) and then compare the output of both.
