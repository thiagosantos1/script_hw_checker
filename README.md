# Script for Homework Checker
A bash script, combined with python, to help students check their assignments.

# Main idea
The idea is to help my students when doing their homework. If this script, you can pre-check/grade an assignment. Basically, the script compiles and execute 2 programs(one from professor and one from student) and then compare the output of both. 

# How to use it
* Inside of check_hw.sh you must list all homeworks available to check. 

1) To check a homework, you just type ./check_hw.sh assig_name
