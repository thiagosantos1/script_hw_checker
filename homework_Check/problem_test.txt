Carla, a 10 year old girl, has started her own little market of selling lemonade. She is having a hard time to calculate how much profit she is making every day. Can you help her?

Write a program to:
	1) Read the following input:
		* How many lemonade she sold
		* How much does she sell each lemonade?
		* How much does it cost to make 1 lemonade?

	2) Output Carla's profit

Example:

Inputs:
	lemonades sold = 100
	price of each lemonade = 3
	cost of each lemonade = 1

Output:
	Carla made $200.00 of profit today.

Hint: Profit may be a fractional number. Therefore, print with 2 decimal places
